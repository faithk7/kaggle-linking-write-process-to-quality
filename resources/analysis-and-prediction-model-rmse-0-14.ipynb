this analysis, we found that the variable 'action_time_mean' has a moderate negative correlation with the variable 'word_count' (-0.555) and a low negative correlation with the variable 'score' (-0.049).

However, it's important to note that this relationship is not very strong and does not have a significant influence in this context.\n\nFurthermore, there is no significant relationship between the average typing time ('action_time_mean') and the essay score ('score'). So, how long someone types is not directly related to the achieved essay score.\n\nOn the other hand, the variable 'word_count' has a moderate positive correlation with the variable 'score' (0.64). This means that using more words in the essay is likely to result in a higher essay score.

I hope my story will captivate your interest and keep you awake throughout :D. So, without further ado, let's dive into the world of storytelling!\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a group of individuals who participated in a typing competition. They were all eager to achieve the highest possible \"score\" and showcase their typing skills. As they embarked on this journey, researchers closely observed their actions and analyzed the data to uncover the factors that influenced their performance.\n\nThe researchers noticed that some actions had a significant impact on the participants' \"score,\" while others seemed less influential. Let's explore these findings together.\n\nFirst, the researchers discovered that the average time it took for participants to perform each action had a weak negative correlation with their \"score.\" This means that spending too much time on individual actions didn't necessarily lead to higher scores. It was more about finding a balance between speed and accuracy.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of words participants typed had a strong positive correlation with their \"score.\" This finding emphasized the importance of productivity and being able to type a higher number of words within the given time.\n\nThe researchers also examined the average time participants spent on upward and downward movements while typing. Surprisingly, there was a weak negative correlation between the duration of these movements and the participants' \"score.\" It seemed that excessive time spent on moving their fingers up and down didn't contribute significantly to their performance.\n\nHowever, when the researchers looked at the total duration of these movements, they found a moderate positive correlation with the participants' \"score.\" This indicated that participants who had a good balance between efficient movements and overall typing speed tended to achieve higher scores.\n\nAs the researchers delved deeper into the analysis, they explored the participants' usage of specific keys. They discovered that certain key events had varying degrees of correlation with the \"score.\"\n\nFor example, the count of backspace events showed a moderate positive correlation with the \"score.\" This suggested that participants who made use of the backspace key to correct their mistakes tended to have higher scores.\n\nSimilarly, the count of space events had a strong positive correlation with the \"score.\" It appeared that participants who utilized the spacebar more frequently, indicating better sentence structure and spacing, tended to achieve higher scores.\n\nOther key events, such as left-click, shift, enter, tab, caps lock, control, and delete, showed weak to moderate positive correlations with the \"score.\" While these events had some influence on participants' performance, their impact was not as pronounced as the backspace and space events.\n\nIn a nutshell, the researchers concluded that in this typing competition, factors like word count, total duration of movements, and the counts of backspace and space events played significant roles in determining the participants' \"score.\" Other variables, such as the average time for individual actions and counts of other key events, had weaker correlations or no substantial influence on the overall performance.\n\nThese findings provided valuable insights for the participants and anyone seeking to improve their typing skills. It highlighted the importance of finding a balance between speed and accuracy, focusing on productivity, and utilizing key functions like backspace and space effectively.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Statistical Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 =
